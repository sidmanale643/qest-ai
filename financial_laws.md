# Foreword

“Money is like manure. You have to spread it around or it smells.”

- J. Paul Getty

India is one of the largest emerging markets in the world with enormous potential for growth in the coming years. The financial market is also expanding and attracting ever-increasing number of domestic and foreign investors. Efficient transfer of resources from those having idle resources to others who have a pressing need for them is achieved through financial markets.

The functioning of financial markets is regulated by several legislations that include Acts, Rules, Regulations, Guidelines, Circulars, etc. Understanding the legislations governing the financial markets in India will give the reader a fair idea of how the financial markets in India are regulated.

I am glad that the Committee on Financial markets and Investors’ Protection of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is bringing out ‘A Guide on Laws applicable to Indian Financial Markets’. It covers the various legislations governing the financial markets in India. It aims to provide substantive and useful information to both a professional and common man.

I take this opportunity to congratulate CA. Rajkumar S. Adukia, Chairman and the entire team of Committee on Financial Markets and Investors’ Protection for their initiatives and endeavours.

# Preface

"Financial peace isn't the acquisition of stuff. It's learning to live on less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to invest. You can't win until you do this." - Dave Ramsey

Normally, a business enterprise needs finance for two purposes - for buying capital equipment and fixed assets, such as machinery, tools and implements, power plant, construction of factory building and workshops, etc.; which are referred to as long-term capital requirements, and for buying raw materials, holding the stock of finished goods, for payment of wages, etc., which are referred to as short-term capital requirements. Thus, an industrial house has to borrow short-term funds as well as long-term funds. The money-market caters to the short-term needs only. The long-term capital needs are satisfied by the capital market. Thus the combination of both money market and capital market forms the financial market.

The financial market covers the instruments and institutions which provide finance for short and long period. Financial markets provide channels for allocation of savings to investment. It provides a variety of assets to savers as well as various forms in which the investors can raise funds and thereby combine the acts of saving and investment. The savers and investors are constrained not by their individual abilities, but by the economy’s ability, to invest and save respectively. Thus, the financial markets contribute to economic development to the extent that the latter depends on the rates of savings and investment.

It has been argued that strong legal systems foster development of sophisticated financial markets and intermediaries, which enhances the economy’s ability to manage risk and eventually lead to economic growth. The financial system of India which includes banking, capital, insurance, securities, foreign exchange etc. is characterized by several legislations for regulation and enforcement. Just like the developments and changes in financial markets are
---
closely monitored, the regular changes in the financial laws of our country also need to be followed. This book gives a broad view of the legislations regulating the financial markets in India.

I sincerely appreciate the efforts put in by Adv. Y. Rashmi Vinod in preparing the publication.

I would like to thank CA. Jay Ajit Chhaira, Vice-Chairman, CFMIP and all members of the CFMIP committee, CA Pankaj Inderchand Jain, CA Sanjeev Maheswari, CA S Santhana Krishnan, CA Anuj Goyal, CA Naveen N.D. Gupta, CA Sharad Kabra, Shri Sidharth K. Birla, Shri Sunil Kanoria, CA Vikas Jain, CA Murmuria Bijay, CA. Shyam Lal Agarwal who have extended their support and encouragement in all committee activities.

I would also like to thank all the persons who contributed towards finalizing this publication.

I firmly believe that the publication will be helpful to all concerned.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

Financial system is basically a set of complex and closely interconnected financial institutions, markets, instruments, services, practices, and transactions. It is crucial to the system in a modern economy. They channel household savings to the corporate sector and allocate investment funds among firms; they allow inter temporal smoothing of consumption by households and expenditures by firms; and they enable households and firms to share risks. These functions are common to the financial systems of most developed economies.

The financial system in India comprises of financial institutions, financial markets, financial instruments and services.

# 1.1. What is a financial market?

Financial market is a broad term describing any marketplace where buyers and sellers participate in the trade of assets such as equities, bonds, currencies and derivatives. Financial market is typically defined by having transparent pricing, basic regulations on trading, costs and fees and market forces determining the prices of securities that trade. A market is a location where buyers and sellers come into contact to exchange goods or services. Markets can exist in various forms depending on various factors.
---
The financial markets permit both business and government to raise the needed funds by selling securities. Simultaneously, investors with excess funds are able to invest and earn a return, enhancing their welfare. Financial markets are absolutely vital for the proper functioning of capitalistic economies, because they serve to channel funds from savers to borrowers.

Financial markets facilitate:

- The raising of capital (in the capital markets)
- The transfer of risk (in the derivatives markets)
- Price discovery
- Global transactions with integration of financial markets
- The transfer of liquidity (in the money markets)
- International trade (in the currency markets)
- and are used to match those who want capital to those who have it.

# 1.2. Basic functions of financial markets

Financial markets serve six basic functions. These functions are briefly listed below:

- Borrowing and Lending: Financial markets permit the transfer of funds (purchasing power) from one agent to another for either investment or consumption purposes.
- Price Determination: Financial markets provide vehicles by which prices are set both for newly issued financial assets and for the existing stock of financial assets.
- Information Aggregation and Coordination: Financial markets act as collectors and aggregators of information about financial asset values and the flow of funds from lenders to borrowers.
- Risk Sharing: Financial markets allow a transfer of risk from those who undertake investments to those who provide funds for those investments.
- Liquidity: Financial markets provide the holders of financial assets with a chance to resell or liquidate these assets.
- Efficiency: Financial markets reduce transaction costs and information costs.
---
# 1.3. Types of financial markets

Within the financial sector, the term “financial markets” is often used to refer just to the markets that are used to raise finance: for long term finance, the Capital markets; for short term finance, the Money markets. Another common use of the term is as a catchall for all the markets in the financial sector, as per examples in the breakdown below.

- Capital markets which consist of:
- Stock markets, which provide financing through the issuance of shares or common stock, and enable the subsequent trading thereof.
- Bond markets, which provide financing through the issuance of bonds, and enable the subsequent trading thereof.
- Commodity markets, which facilitate the trading of commodities.
- Money markets, which provide short term debt financing and investment.
- Derivatives markets, which provide instruments for the management of financial risk.
- Futures markets, which provide standardized forward contracts for trading products at some future date;
- Insurance markets, which facilitate the redistribution of various risks.
- Foreign exchange markets, which facilitate the trading of foreign exchange.

The Money market refers to the market where borrowers and lenders exchange short term funds to solve their liquidity needs. Money market instruments are generally financial claims that have low default risk, maturities under one year and high marketability.

The Capital market is a market for financial investments that are direct or indirect claims to capital. It is wider than the Securities Market and embraces all forms of lending and borrowing, whether or not evidenced by the creation of a negotiable financial instrument.

The Securities Market, however, refers to the markets for those financial instruments/claims/obligations that are commonly and readily transferable by sale. It is a place where buyers and sellers of securities can enter into transactions to purchase and sell shares, bonds.
---
debentures etc. Further, it performs an important role of enabling corporate, entrepreneurs to raise resources for their companies and business ventures through public issues. Transfer of resources from those having idle resources (investors) to others who have a need for them (corporates) is most efficiently achieved through the securities market.

# Debt Market

Debt instrument represents a contract whereby one party lends money to another on pre-determined terms with regards to rate and periodicity of interest, repayment of principal amount by the borrower to the lender. In the Indian securities markets, the term ‘bond’ is used for debt instruments issued by the Central and State governments and public sector organizations and the term ‘debenture’ is used for instruments issued by private corporate sector.

The National Stock Exchange of India started its trading operations in June 1994 by enabling the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment of the Exchange. This segment provides a trading platform for a wide range of fixed income securities that includes central government securities, treasury bills (T-bills), state development loans (SDLs), bonds issued by public sector undertakings (PSUs), floating rate bonds (FRBs), zero coupon bonds (ZCBs), index bonds, commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CDs), corporate debentures, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions (FIs), bonds issued by foreign institutions and units of mutual funds (MFs).

The emergence of the Derivatives market, most notably forwards, futures and options, can be traced back to the willingness of risk-averse economic agents to guard themselves against uncertainties arising out of fluctuations in asset prices. By their very nature, the financial markets are marked by a very high degree of volatility. Through the use of derivative products, it is possible to partially or fully transfer price risks by locking–in asset prices. As instruments of risk management, these generally do not influence the fluctuations in the underlying asset prices. Derivative is a product whose value is derived from the value of one or more basic variables, called bases (underlying asset, index, or reference rate), in a contractual manner. The underlying asset can be equity, forex, commodity or any other asset.

# Commodity Market

A commodity market is a market that trades in primary rather than manufactured products. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as (gold, rubber and oil). Investors access about 50 major commodity
---
Markets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.

Mutual funds are investment companies that use the funds from investors to invest in other companies or investment alternatives. Mutual Fund Schemes may be classified on the Basis of its Structure and its Investment Objective. An open-ended mutual fund is the one whose units can be freely sold and repurchased by the investors. Closed-ended mutual funds have a fixed number of units, and a fixed tenure (3, 5, 10, or 15 years), after which their units are redeemed or they are made open-ended. These funds have various objectives: generating steady income by investing in debt instruments, capital appreciation by investing in equities, or both by making an equal allocation of the corpus in debt and equity instruments. Interval funds combine the features of open-ended and close-ended schemes. They are open for sale or redemption during pre-determined intervals at NAV related prices.

# 1.4. Major players in financial markets

# i. Brokers

A broker is a commissioned agent of a buyer (or seller) who facilitates trade by locating a seller (or buyer) to complete the desired transaction. A broker does not take a position in the assets he or she trades - that is, the broker does not maintain inventories in these assets. The profits of brokers are determined by the commissions they charge to the users of their services (the buyers, the sellers, or both). Examples of brokers include real estate brokers and stock brokers.

# ii. Dealers

Like brokers, dealers facilitate trade by matching buyers with sellers of assets; they do not engage in asset transformation. Unlike brokers, however, a dealer can and does “take positions” (i.e., maintain inventories) in the assets he or she trades that permit the dealer to sell out of inventory rather than always having to locate sellers to match every offer to buy. Also, unlike brokers, dealers do not receive sales commissions. Rather, dealers make profits by buying assets at
---
# iii. Investment Banks

An investment bank assists in the initial sale of newly issued securities (i.e., in IPOs = Initial Public Offerings) by engaging in a number of different activities like advice, underwriting, sales assistance etc.

# iv. Financial Intermediaries

Unlike brokers, dealers, and investment banks, financial intermediaries are financial institutions that engage in financial asset transformation. That is, financial intermediaries purchase one kind of financial asset from borrowers - generally some kind of long-term loan contract whose terms are adapted to the specific circumstances of the borrower (e.g., a mortgage) and sell a different kind of financial asset to savers, generally some kind of relatively liquid claim against the financial intermediary (e.g., a deposit account). In addition, unlike brokers and dealers, financial intermediaries typically hold financial assets as part of an investment portfolio rather than as an inventory for resale. Types of financial intermediaries include commercial banks, life insurance companies, pension funds, finance companies, mutual funds etc.

# 1.5. Role and functions of financial market

One of the important requisite for the accelerated development of an economy is the existence of a dynamic financial market. A financial market helps the economy in the following manner.

- Saving mobilization: Obtaining funds from the savers or surplus units such as household individuals, business firms, public sector units, central government, state governments etc. is an important role played by financial markets.
- Investment: Financial markets play a crucial role in arranging to invest funds thus collected in those units which are in need of the same.
- National Growth: An important role played by financial markets is that they contribute to a nation’s growth by ensuring unfettered flow of surplus funds to deficit units. Flow of funds for productive purposes is also made possible.
---
# Financial Markets and Their Functions

• Entrepreneurship growth: Financial markets contribute to the development of the entrepreneurial class by making available the necessary financial resources.

• Industrial development: The different components of financial markets help an accelerated growth of industrial and economic development of a country, thus contributing to raising the standard of living and the society of well-being.

# The functions of financial markets include the following:

• Transfer of Resources: Financial markets facilitate the transfer of real economic resources from lenders to ultimate borrowers.

• Enhancing income: Financial markets allow lenders to earn interest or dividend on their surplus invisible funds, thus contributing to the enhancement of the individual and the national income.

• Productive usage: Financial markets allow for the productive use of the funds borrowed.

• Capital Formation: Financial markets provide a channel through which new savings flow to aid capital formation of a country.

• Price determination: Financial markets allow for the determination of price of the traded financial assets through the interaction of buyers and sellers. They provide a sign for the allocation of funds in the economy based on the demand and supply through the mechanism called price discovery process.

• Sale Mechanism: Financial markets provide a mechanism for selling of a financial asset by an investor so as to offer the benefit of marketability and liquidity of such assets.

• Information: The activities of the participants in the financial market result in the generation and the consequent dissemination of information to the various segments of the market.

# Financial Functions

• Providing the borrower with funds so as to enable them to carry out their investment plans.

• Providing the lenders with earning assets so as to enable them to earn wealth by deploying the assets in production debentures.

• Providing liquidity in the market so as to facilitate trading of funds.

• It provides liquidity to commercial bank.

# 1.6. International scope of financial markets

Financial markets are increasingly becoming international in scope. Integration of transatlantic financial markets began early in the nineteenth century and accelerated after the mid-nineteenth-century introduction of the transoceanic telegraph systems. The process reversed early in the twentieth century due to World Wars I and II and the cold war; the demise of the gold standard; and the rise of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, discretionary monetary policy, and capital immobility. With the end of the Bretton Woods arrangement in the early 1970s and the cold war in the late 1980s/early 1990s, financial globalization reversed course once again. Today, governments, corporations, and other securities issuers (borrowers) can sell bonds, called foreign bonds, in a foreign country denominated in that foreign country’s currency. (For example, the Mexican government can sell dollar-denominated bonds in U.S. markets.) Issuers can also sell Eurobonds or Eurocurrencies, bonds issued (created and sold) in foreign countries but denominated in the home country’s currency. For example, U.S. companies can sell dollar denominated bonds in London and U.S. dollars can be deposited in non-U.S. banks. It now also quite easy to invest in foreign stock exchanges, many of which have grown in size and importance in the last few years.
---
# 2. WHAT IS CAPITAL MARKET?

Capital market is one of the most important segments of the Indian financial system. It is the market available to the companies for meeting their requirements of the long-term funds.

The term capital market means institutional arrangements for facilitating the borrowing and lending of long term funds. In other words, it consists of a series of channels through which the savings of the community are made available for industrial and commercial enterprises.

Capital market is the market for long term funds, just as the money market is the market for short term funds. It refers to all the facilities and the institutional arrangements for borrowing and lending term funds (medium-term and long-term funds). It does not deal in capital goods but is concerned with the raising of money capital for purposes of investment.

The market consists of a number of individuals and institutions (including the Government) that canalize the supply and demand for long-term capital and claims on it. The demand for long term capital comes predominantly from private sector manufacturing industries, agriculture sector, trade and the Government agencies. While, the supply of funds for the capital market comes largely from individual and corporate savings, banks, insurance companies, specialised financing agencies and the surplus of Governments.

Among the institutions, we may refer to the following:

1. Commercial banks are important investors, but are largely interested in govt. securities and to a small extent, debentures of companies;
2. LIC and GIC are of growing importance in the Indian capital market, though their major interest is in government securities;
3. Provident funds constitute a major medium of savings but their investment too are mostly in govt. securities;
4. Special institutions set up since independence, viz., IFCI, ICICI, IDBI, UTI, etc. –generally called development financial institutions (DFIs) –aim at supplying long term capital to the private sector.
5. There are financial intermediaries in the capital market, such as merchant bankers, mutual funds leasing companies etc.
---
help in mobilizing savings and supplying funds to investors. Like all markets, the capital market is also composed of those who demand funds (borrowers) and those who supply funds (lenders). An ideal capital attempts to provide adequate capital at reasonable rate of return for any business which offers a prospective yield high enough to make borrowing worthwhile.

The size of a nation’s capital markets is directly proportional to the size of its economy. The United States, the world’s largest economy, has the biggest and deepest capital markets. Capital markets are increasingly interconnected in a globalized economy, which means that ripples in one corner can cause major waves elsewhere. The drawback of this interconnection is best illustrated by the global credit crisis of 2007-09, which was triggered by the collapse in U.S. mortgage-backed securities. The effects of this meltdown were globally transmitted by capital markets since banks and institutions in Europe and Asia held trillions of dollars of these securities.

# Division of Capital Market

- Financial institutions
- Securities market
- Gilt-edged market
- Corporate securities market
- Primary market
- Secondary market

The Indian capital market is broadly divided into the gilt-edged market and the securities market.

- The gilt-edged market refers to the market for Government and semi-government securities, backed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Government securities are tradeable debt instruments issued by the Government for meeting its financial requirements. The term gilt-edged means ‘of the best quality’. This is because the Government securities do not suffer from risk of default and are highly liquid (as they can be easily sold in the market at their current price). The open market operations of the RBI are also conducted in such securities.
- The securities market refers to the market which deals in equities and debentures of the corporates. It is further divided into primary
---
# Market and Secondary Market

# Primary Market (New Issue Market)

Deals with ‘new securities’, that is, securities which were not previously available and are offered to the investing public for the first time. The issuer may be a new company or an existing company. These issues may be of new type or the security used in the past. In the primary market, the issuer can be considered as a manufacturer. The issuing houses, investment bankers, and brokers act as the channel of distribution for the new issues. They take the responsibility of selling the stocks to the public.

The main service functions of the primary market are origination, underwriting, and distribution. Origination deals with the origin of the new issue. The proposal is analyzed in terms of the nature of the security, the size of the issue, timing of the issue, and flotation method of the issue. Underwriting contract makes the share predictable and removes the element of uncertainty in the subscription. Distribution refers to the sale of securities to the investors. This is carried out with the help of the lead managers and brokers to the issue.

# Secondary Market/Stock Market (Old Issues Market or Stock Exchange)

Is the market for buying and selling securities of the existing companies. Under this, securities are traded after being initially offered to the public in the primary market and/or listed on the stock exchange. The stock exchanges are the exclusive centres for trading of securities. It is a sensitive barometer and reflects the trends in the economy through fluctuations in the prices of various securities. It has been defined as, “a body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating and controlling the business of buying, selling and dealing in securities.” Listing on stock exchanges enables the shareholders to monitor the movement of the share prices in an effective manner. This assists those to take prudent decisions on whether to retain their holdings or sell off or even accumulate further. However, to list the securities on a stock exchange, the issuing company has to go through set norms and procedures.

# Features of Capital Market

1. Link between Savers and Investment Opportunities: Capital market is a crucial link between saving and investment process. The capital market transfers money from savers to
---
# 1. Characteristics of Capital Market

1. Deals in Long Term Investment:
Capital market provides funds for long and medium term. It does not deal with channelizing saving for less than one year.
2. Utilizes Intermediaries:
Capital market makes use of different intermediaries such as brokers, underwriters, depositories etc. These intermediaries act as working organs of capital market and are very important elements of capital market.
3. Determinant of Capital Formation:
The activities of capital market determine the rate of capital formation in an economy. Capital market offers attractive opportunities to those who have surplus funds so that they invest more and more in capital market and are encouraged to save more for profitable opportunities.
4. Government Rules and Regulations:
The capital market operates freely but under the guidance of government policies. These markets function within the framework of government rules and regulations, e.g., stock exchange works under the regulations of SEBI which is a government body.

# An ideal capital market is one:

1. Where finance is available at reasonable cost.
2. Which facilitates economic growth.
3. Where market operations are free, fair, competitive and transparent.
4. Must provide sufficient information to investors.
5. Must allocate capital productively.

# 2.1. History of Capital Market in India

The history of capital market system in India could be divided into two eras – pre-independence era and post-independence era.

# Pre-independence Era

Before independence, the capital market of India was ill developed. India during the British rule exhibited most of the fundamental characteristics.
---
of an underdeveloped economy in a distinct manner. Before the arrival of British in India, the economy of India had lost momentum and was fast settling down to a semi-static equilibrium condition. Two basic characteristics were prominent in the period before British rule started in India - a high degree of income inequality and conspicuous consumption (i.e. consumption of luxury items) by the wealthy class. The tendency of wasting the potential surplus of the country in conspicuous consumption by the richer class in the form of gold and silver hoards instead of investing it for creating bigger surplus for economic development persisted even after the British came to India.

British were not keen in bringing out an all-round economic growth of India. Its main task was to make India complementary to Britain’s own economy and the maintenance of political control. In short, India’s lack of economic development must be attributed, in considerable measure, to her political subordinacy to Great Britain. With political subordinacy went economic subordinacy. From the beginning almost until the end of British ascendancy, India was regarded as a kind of economic complement to Britain. Accordingly, the development of an economically rounded and strong India was never a basic objective of British policy. The result was an automatic suppression of this stimulus to economic growth. A vast number of people were in a state of appalling poverty. The rate of savings in the economy was hopelessly low and the advances made in communications, trade and industry were scarcely enough to meet the pressure of population.

The capital market in India suffered from certain defects in the pre-independence days –

- Agriculture, constituting the main occupation did not lend itself to the floatation of securities. Moreover, in the industrial sector itself production on small scale by sole trading and partnership firms did not leave much scope for the emergence of an organized securities market.
- The growth of securities market was hampered because the foreign business enterprises, which accounted for the greater part of industrial development in the past, depended on the London Capital Market rather than on the Indian market.
- The managing agency system, which was abolished after independence, to a large extent, was also responsible for the non-development of the capital market, for the managing agents acted both as promoting and marketing agencies and the capital market was characterized by an absence of special institutions to float new issues.
---
Due to underdevelopment of industries the total number of securities which were traded in on stock exchanges was not large. Government securities accounted for nearly half the total volume of issues in the capital market. Ordinary shares were the predominant type of security, while debentures and preference shares, whose price movements usually showed a close correlation with those of government securities, occupied a limited place.

The poor investment habits of the individuals and the restrictions imposed on the investment patterns of the various financial institutions circumscribed the capital market. The institutional investors primarily invested in Government and semi-Government securities. Further, the speculators were mostly interested in a short list of speculative shares. As a result, the class of investors to purchase industrial securities on a wide basis was small and there was absence of continuous dealings in a large range of securities.

In the unorganized sector of the capital market indigenous banking as different from the modern western banking had been organized in the form of family or individual business. The indigenous bankers have been variously called as Shroffs, Seths, Sahukars, Mahajans, Chettis etc. in different parts of the country. They vary in their size from petty moneylenders to substantial shroffs who carry on large and specialized business, which at times exceeds that of the scheduled banks. Despite the predominant role played by the indigenous bankers in India’s economic life, they have always remained outside the pale of organized banking.

In 1935, when Reserve Bank of India had started many attempts to bring the indigenous bankers under its orbit and issued a draft scheme for direct linking of these bankers, RBI suggested that the indigenous bankers should give-up their trading and commission business, switch over to western system of accounting, develop the deposit side of banking activities, have their accounts audited by certified accountants, submit to RBI periodical statements of their affairs etc. RBI desired that the ambiguous character of the Hundi should cease and that it should become a negotiable instrument representing a genuine trade transaction. RBI also desired that the indigenous bankers should act as discount houses, (to buy and sell bills of exchange etc) and against these obligations, RBI promised to provide them with all the privileges enjoyed by scheduled banks. They would then be allowed to borrow from or rediscount bills of exchange at RBI on similar terms and conditions as available to scheduled banks.

But the indigenous bankers, with their age-old traditions of independence,
---
declined to accept the restrictions as well as the compensating benefits of securing accommodation from RBI on favorable terms. They disagreed to give up their trading and commission business and accept deposits, thereby confining themselves to banking business only. They were also unwilling to give wide publicity to their accounts and their state of affairs. They did not consider that the privileges offered by RBI were adequate enough to compensate for the loss of their non-banking business. As a result, the scheme proposed by RBI to bring the indigenous bankers under its direct influence fell through.

In spite of all these defects, they occupy a very prominent position in the capital market in the country and at one time they were estimated to meet at least 90% of the financial requirements of the farmers and a substantial portion of the needs of the industry and trade.

# Post-Independence Era

In recent years since independence, the capital market of India has substantially changed and has been changing for the better. The concentrated efforts on the part of the government and the growth of investment-mindedness of the people have made this possible. Capital market in India till the recent past, had all the characteristics of an underdeveloped economy. It was characterized by the conspicuous absence of institutions like, professional promoters, investment or issue houses, underwriting agencies and financial intermediaries. As a result, free flow of savings to industrial investment was impeded resulting in the stagnant character of our economy. Thus, serious flaws existed in the structure of capital market in India.

However, the achievement of independence in 1947 marked a trend towards an organized growth of capital market. After achieving political independence, government took over the responsibility of giving shape to those coveted ideals of our economy, which were enshrined in our Constitution by way of the Directive Principles of state policy. When the Constitution was framed, the government defined its basic economic and social goals that were later on summed up in the expression “socialist pattern of society”. These ideals directed the government to promote the welfare of the society by securing and promoting a social order in which justice, equality and fraternity could prevail. The resolution was adopted at the Avadhi Session of Congress in 1954 to build the society on the socialistic pattern. “Ever since then this has been the light house of our economic policy”, “Growth with social justice” and “Social Gain not private Profit”, have been the major planks of our plan policies.

These basic objectives had a significant bearing on the organization of the Capital Market. But it required effective control on government over the distribution of credit and finance and thus it could not be isolated
---
from the strategy of economic development. In the post independence days, the government had committed itself to reorganize the Indian Capital Market. The government’s commitments towards industrialization also required the removal of basic deficiencies of the capital market. The existing financial institutions could only partly meet the financial requirements of industries. Priority now shifted from private ownership to public control. The first amongst these actions was the nationalization of RBI in 1948. The setting up of the SBI followed this, by taking over the Imperial Bank of India in 1956. In the same year the government also took a drastic action by rationalizing and merging as many as 245 life insurance companies into a state owned monolithic LIC of India. The year 1969 represents a landmark in the history of public control of private financial institutions when the 14 major Commercial Banks were nationalized.

Setting up of Unit Trust of India, July 1, 1964 for mobilizing the small savings for investment in corporate securities and investment of life insurance funds and provident funds in industrial securities would help in strengthening the base of capital market. The changes in the growth of capital market in India can be analyzed also by a reference to the data relating to new issues of capital formation and working of corporate sectors. Various developments in the Indian capital market, removing its basic deficiencies, since independence can be reviewed as follows:

- The adoption of an elaborate legislative code to protect the investor’s interest has offered a salutary effect in the development of capital market. The Companies Act 1956, designed to safeguard the interest of shareholders, the Capital Issues (Control) Act to discourage undesirable practices like issue of shares with disproportionate voting rights and to prevent investment in non-essential enterprises, the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act 1956, to provide reforms in stock exchange trading methods and practices against undesirable manipulations, are some of the steps introduced to have a strong and healthy investment market having full confidence of the public.
- The striking success of several industrial issues, home and foreign, indicate that in recent years more and more people have become investment conscious and ready to put their savings in corporate securities.
- There was no institutionalized system of underwriting in the country before independence. But during the post independence
---
period the under-writing activity made satisfactory progress with the establishment of specialized institutions of industrial finance. The underwriting operations got impetus by the establishment of strong underwriting organizations like, Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Unit Trust of India and Industrial Development Bank of India. The emergence of this institutionalized underwriting structure is of crucial importance for the efficient operation of the new issue market in the country.

- The growth of capital market was indirectly influenced by the activities of Commercial Banks, which provided advances essentially for working capital against shares, and debentures, which thereby encouraged investment in industrial securities. Further, by providing funds to finance corporations through the purchase of their shares and debentures and by underwriting either singly or in association with other banks and institutions. Commercial Banks have greatly influenced the growth of capital market.
- Immediately after independence in 1947, the ardent need for large-scale industrial development paved the way for the establishment of several special finance and development corporations.
- The most striking change in the capital market is the integration of the organized and unorganized sectors of the capital market on the one hand and the money and the capital market on the other. The integration has been proceeding steadily due to the growth of joint stock form of business, the expanding role of the Reserve Bank in the sphere of rural credit, the extension of banking facilities into the interior of the country, the diversification of the functions of commercial bank and government assistance to industry have all been the contributive factors to this integration.
- The establishment of Unit Trust of India (which started its public operations from July 1, 1964) and the Industrial Development Bank of India under the auspices of the Reserve Bank of India had a combining effect in strengthening and broadening the framework of the capital market in India as the source for the supply of funds to industry.

# 2.2. Securities market in India

The corporate securities market in India dates back to the 18th century
---
when the securities of the East India Company were traded in Mumbai and Kolkotta. The brokers used to gather under a Banyan tree in Mumbai and under a Neem tree in Kolkata for the purpose of trading those securities. However the real beginning came in the 1850’s with the introduction of joint stock companies with limited liability. The 1860’s witnessed feverish dealings in securities and reckless speculation. This brought brokers in Mumbai together in July 1875 to form the first formally organized stock exchange in the country viz. The Stock Exchange, Mumbai. Ahmedabad stock exchange in 1894 and 22 others followed this in the 20th century.

The process of reforms has led to a pace of growth almost unparalleled in the history of any country. The process of economic reforms and liberalization was set in motion in the mid-eighties and its pace was accelerated in 1991 when the economy suffered severely from a precariously low foreign exchange reserve, burgeoning imbalance on the external account, declining industrial production, galloping inflation and a rising fiscal deficit. The economic reforms, being an integrated process, included deregulation of industry, liberalization in foreign investment, regime, restructuring and liberalization of trade, exchange rate, and tax policies, partial disinvestments of government holding in public sector companies and financial sector reforms.

The reforms in the real sectors such as trade, industry and fiscal policy were initiated first in order to create the necessary macroeconomic stability for launching financial sector reforms, which sought to improve the functioning of banking and financial institutions (FIs) and strengthen money and capital markets including securities market. The securities market reforms specifically included:

- Repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 through which Government used to expropriate and allocate resources from capital market for favored uses;
- Enactment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to provide for the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to regulate and promote development of securities market;
- Setting up of NSE in 1993, passing of the Depositories Act, 1996 to provide for the maintenance and transfer of ownership of securities in book entry form;
- Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 in 1999 to provide for the introduction of futures and option.
- Other measures included free pricing of securities, investor
---
protection measures, use of information technology, dematerialization of securities, improvement in trading practices, evolution of an efficient and transparent regulatory framework, emergence of several innovative financial products and services and specialized FIs etc. These reforms were aimed at creating efficient and competitive securities market subject to effective regulation by SEBI, which would ensure investor protection.

Securities market in India has grown exponentially as measured in terms of amount raised from the market, number of stock exchanges and other intermediaries, the number of listed stocks, market capitalization, trading volumes and turnover on stock exchanges, investor population and price indices. Along with this, the profiles of the investors, issuers and intermediaries have changed significantly. The market has witnessed fundamental institutional changes resulting in drastic reduction in transaction costs and significant improvements in efficiency, transparency and safety, thanks to the National Stock Exchange. Indian market is now comparable to many developed markets in terms of a number of parameters.

# 3. MONEY MARKET

One of the sections of a financial market where securities and financial instruments with short-term maturities are traded is called the money market. It deals in funds and financial instruments having a maturity period of one day to one year.

Financial assets like treasury bills, certificates of deposits, commercial paper and bankers’ acceptance are some of the short-term debt securities traded in the money market.

RBI being the main constituent in the money market aims at ensuring that liquidity and short term interest rates are consistent with the monetary policy objectives. RBI describes money market as “the centre for dealings, mainly of a short-term character, in monetary assets, it meets the short-term requirements of borrowers and provides liquidity or cash to lenders”.

The money market functions are -

- Transfer of large sums of money
- Transfer from parties with surplus funds to parties with a deficit
- Allow governments to raise funds
- Help to implement monetary policy
- Determine short-term interest rates

The Indian money market consists of the unorganised sector: moneylenders, indigenous bankers, chit funds; organised sector: Reserve Bank of India, private banks, public sector banks, development banks and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such as Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the International Finance Corporation, IDBI, and the co-operative sector.

# Money market and Capital Market

Money Market is a place for short term lending and borrowing, typically within a year. It deals in short term debt financing and investments. On the other hand, Capital Market refers to stock market, which refers to trading in shares and bonds of companies on recognized stock exchanges. Individual players cannot invest in money market as the value of investments is large, on the other hand, in capital market, anybody can make investments through a broker. Stock Market is
---
associated with high risk and high return as against money market which is more secure. Further, in case of money market, deals are transacted on phone or through electronic systems as against capital market where trading is through recognized stock exchanges.

# Money Market Instruments

# 1) Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury bills (T-bills) offer short-term investment opportunities, generally up to one year. They are thus useful in managing short-term liquidity. At present, the Government of India issues three types of treasury bills through auctions, namely, 91-day, 182-day and 364-day. There are no treasury bills issued by State Governments.

Treasury bills are available for a minimum amount of Rs.25,000 and in multiples of Rs. 25,000. Treasury bills are issued at a discount and are redeemed at par. Treasury bills are also issued under the Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS).

# 2) Repurchase Agreements

Repurchase transactions, called Repo or Reverse Repo are transactions or short term loans in which two parties agree to sell and repurchase the same security. They are usually used for overnight borrowing. Repo/Reverse Repo transactions can be done only between the parties approved by RBI and in RBI approved securities viz. Government Of India and State Government Securities, T-Bills, PSU Bonds, FI Bonds, Corporate Bonds etc. Under repurchase agreement the seller sells specified securities with an agreement to repurchase the same at a mutually decided future date and price. Similarly, the buyer purchases the securities with an agreement to resell the same to the seller on an agreed date at a predetermined price. Such a transaction is called a Repo when viewed from the perspective of the seller of the securities and Reverse Repo when viewed from the perspective of the buyer of the securities.

# 3) Commercial Papers (CP)

Commercial Papers were introduced in January 1990. Commercial Papers can be issued by a listed company which have working capital of not less than Rs. 5 crores. They can be issued in multiple of Rs. 25 lakhs and the minimum size of issue being Rs. 1 crore. At present the maturity period of CPs ranges between 7 days to 1 year. CPs are issued at a discount to its face value and
---
# 4) Certificate of Deposit (CD)

Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a negotiable money market instrument and issued in dematerialised form or as a Usance Promissory Note against funds deposited at a bank or other eligible financial institution for a specified time period. Guidelines for issue of CDs are presently governed by various directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as amended from time to time.

Minimum amount of a CD should be Rs.1 lakh, i.e., the minimum deposit that could be accepted from a single subscriber should not be less than Rs.1 lakh, and in multiples of Rs. 1 lakh thereafter. The maturity period of CDs issued by banks should not be less than 7 days and not more than one year, from the date of issue. The FIs (financial institutions) can issue CDs for a period not less than 1 year and not exceeding 3 years from the date of issue.

# 5) Banker’s Acceptance

A banker’s acceptance is a short-term investment plan created by a company or firm with a guarantee from a bank. It is a guarantee from the bank that a buyer will pay the seller at a future date. A good credit rating is required by the company or firm drawing the bill. The terms for these instruments are usually 90 days, but this period can vary between 30 and 180 days. Companies use the acceptance as a time draft for financing imports, exports and other trade.

# 6) Commercial Bill

Commercial bills are short term, negotiable and self liquidating money market instruments with low risk. A bill of exchange is drawn by a seller on the buyer to make payment within a certain period of time. Generally, the maturity period is of three months. Commercial bill can be resold a number of times during the usance period of bill. The commercial bills are purchased and discounted by commercial banks and are rediscounted by financial institutions.
---
# 4. COMMODITY MARKET

Commodity market is an important constituent of the financial markets of any country. It is the market where a wide range of products, viz., precious metals, base metals, crude oil, energy and soft commodities like palm oil, coffee etc. are traded. It is important to develop a vibrant, active and liquid commodity market. This would help investors hedge their commodity risk, take speculative positions in commodities and exploit arbitrage opportunities in the market.

Investors access about 50 major commodity markets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.

Derivatives such as futures contracts, Swaps, Exchange-traded Commodities, forward contracts etc. have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated commodities exchanges.

The regulatory body for commodity trading in India is the Forward Markets Commission.

# History of the Commodity Futures Market in India

The Commodity Futures market in India dates back to more than a century. The first organized futures market was established in 1875, under the name of ’Bombay Cotton Trade Association’ to trade in cotton derivative contracts. This was followed by institutions for futures trading in oilseeds, foodgrains, etc. The futures market in India underwent rapid growth between the period of First and Second World War. As a result, before the outbreak of the Second World War, a large number of commodity exchanges trading futures contracts in several commodities like cotton, groundnut, groundnut oil, raw jute, jute goods, castorseed, wheat, rice, sugar, precious metals like gold and silver were flourishing throughout the country. In view of the delicate supply situation of major commodities in the backdrop of war efforts mobilization, futures trading came to be prohibited during the Second World War under the Defence of India Act. After Independence, especially in the second half of the
---
1950s and first half of 1960s, the commodity futures trading again picked up and there were thriving commodity markets. However, in mid-1960s, commodity futures trading in most of the commodities was banned and futures trading continued in two minor commodities, viz, pepper and turmeric.

The Khusro Committee (June 1980) had recommended reintroduction of futures trading in most of the major commodities, including cotton, kapas, raw jute and jute goods and suggested that steps may be taken for introducing futures trading in commodities, like potatoes, onions, etc. at appropriate time. The government, accordingly initiated futures trading in Potato during the latter half of 1980, in a few markets in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Futures trading were also resumed in castorseed, and gur (jaggery), and in 1992, extended to Hessian (Jute).

After the introduction of economic reforms in June 1991 and the consequent trade and industry liberalization in both the domestic and external sectors, the Govt. of India appointed in June 1993, a committee on Forward Markets under the Chairmanship of Prof. K.N. Kabra. The Committee submitted its report in September 1994. The majority view of the Committee was that futures trading be introduced in Basmati Rice, Cotton and Kapas, Raw Jute and Jute Goods, Groundnut, rapeseed/mustard seed, cottonseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed, safflower seed, copra and soybean oilseeds, oils and their oilcakes, Rice bran oil, Castor oil and its oilcake, Linseed, Silver and Onion.

The Committee also recommended that some of the existing commodity exchanges particularly those with futures trading in pepper and castor seed, may be upgraded to the level of international futures markets. In April 1999, futures trading was permitted in various edible oilseed complexes.

The National Agriculture Policy announced in July 2000 and the announcements of Hon’ble Finance Minister in the Budget Speech for 2002-2003 indicated the Government’s resolve to put in place a mechanism of futures trade/market. Futures trading in sugar was permitted in May 2001 and the Government issued notifications on 1.4.2003 permitting futures trading in all the commodities. With the issue of these notifications, futures trading is not prohibited in any commodity.

# FORWARD MARKET

The forward market is the informal over-the-counter financial market by which contracts for future delivery are entered into. Standardized forward contracts are called futures contracts and traded on a futures exchange. Forward markets are used for trading a range of instruments including currencies and interest rates, as well as assets such as commodities and securities.

It should not be confused with the futures market, as –

- Future contracts are traded in exchanges whereas a forward Contract is traded over the counter.
- The forward market is highly customized.
- Though the forward market is not exchange traded, chances of parties defaulting are very low.

A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset (which can be of any kind) at a pre-agreed future point in time. Therefore, the trade date and delivery date are separated. It is used to control and hedge risk, for example currency exposure risk (e.g., forward contracts on USD or EURO) or commodity prices (e.g., forward contracts on oil). One party agrees (obligated) to sell, the other to buy, for a forward price agreed in advance. In a forward transaction, no actual cash changes hands. If the transaction is collateralized, exchange of margin will take place according to a pre-agreed rule or schedule. Otherwise no asset of any kind actually changes hands, until the maturity of the contract. The forward price of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the spot price, which is the price at which the asset changes hands (on the spot date, usually two business days). The difference between the spot and the forward price is the forward premium or forward discount.

# 5.1. Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952

The Forward Contracts Regulation Act provides for the regulation of commodity futures markets in India and the establishment of the Forward Markets Commission (FMC). The Forward Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1954 has been issued under the Act.

The need for regulation arises on account of the fact that the benefits of futures markets accrue in competitive conditions. The regulation is
---
needed to create competitive conditions. In the absence of regulation, unscrupulous participants could use these leveraged contracts for manipulating prices. This could have undesirable influence on the spot prices, thereby affecting interests of society at large. Regulation is also needed to ensure that the market has appropriate risk management system. In the absence of such a system, a major default could create a chain reaction. The resultant financial crisis in a futures market could create systematic risk. Regulation is also needed to ensure fairness and transparency in trading, clearing, settlement and management of the exchange so as to protect and promote the interest of various stakeholders, particularly non-member users of the market.

“Forward contract” means a contract for the delivery of goods and which is not a ready delivery contract. “Goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims, money and securities.

Under the Act, only those associations/exchanges, which are granted recognition by the Government, are allowed to organize forward trading in regulated commodities. The Act envisages three-tier regulation:

1. The Exchange which organizes forward trading in commodities can regulate trading on a day-to-day basis;
2. the Forward Markets Commission provides regulatory oversight under the powers delegated to it by the central Government, and
3. the Central Government.

Under Section 15, Government has powers to notify commodities in which forward trading is regulated as also the area in which such regulation will be in force. Once a commodity is notified under section 15, the forward trading in such contracts has to be necessarily between members of the recognized association or through or with any such member. Contracts other than these are illegal.

Under Section 17, the Government has powers to notify commodities, forward trading in which is prohibited in whole or part of India. Any forward trading in such commodities in the notified area is illegal and liable to penal action.

The following persons can be arrested and prosecuted under the Act, 1952:

- Owner or tenant of a place which is used, with the knowledge of such owner and tenant, for entering into or making or performing, whether completely or in part, illegal forward contracts.
- A person who, without permission of the Central Government,
---
organizes or assists in organizing or becomes a member of any association other than recognized association for the purpose of assisting in, entering into or making or performing, whether completely or in part, illegal forward contracts.

- Any person who controls, manages, or assists in keeping any place, other than recognized association for entering into, or making, or performing illegal forward contract, or for clearing or settlement of such contracts.
- Any person who deliberately misrepresents or persuades any person to believe that he is a member of a recognized association or that forward contract can be entered into or made or performed, whether completely or in part, through him.
- Any person who is not a member of a recognized association canvasses, advertises or touts in any business connected with forward contracts in contravention of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952.
- Any person who joins, gathers, or assists in gathering at any place other than the place of business specified in the bye-laws of the recognized associations for making bids or offers or for entering into illegal forward contracts.
- Any person who makes publishes or circulates any statement or information, which is false and which he either knows, or believes to be false, affecting or tending to affect the course of business in forward contracts in permitted commodities.
- Any person who manipulates or attempts to manipulate prices of forward contracts in permitted commodities are liable for punishment under the Act on conviction.

# 5.2. Forward Markets Commission

The Forward Markets Commission (FMC) is a statutory body set up under the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. It functions under the administrative control of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance since September 2013. (Before this, FMC used to function under Department of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Govt. of India. It has its headquarters at Mumbai and one regional office at Kolkata. The Commission comprises of a Chairman, and two Members. It is organized into five administrative divisions to carry out various tasks.

---
to ensure financial integrity (i.e. to prevent systematic risk of default by one major operator or group of operators), market integrity (i.e. to ensure that futures prices are truly aligned with the prospective demand and supply conditions) and to protect & promote interest of consumers /non-members. The Forward Markets Commission performs the role of a market regulator. After assessing the market situation and taking into account the recommendations made by the Board of Directors of the Commodity Exchange, the Commission approves the rules and regulations of the Exchange in accordance with which trading is to be conducted. It accords permission for commencement of trading in different contracts, monitors market conditions continuously and takes remedial measures wherever necessary by imposing various regulatory measures.

# 6. DERIVATIVE MARKET

The term “Derivative” indicates that it has no independent value, i.e. its value is entirely “derived” from the value of the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be securities, commodities, bullion, currency, live stock or anything else. In other words, Derivative means a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of predetermined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities.

India’s tryst with derivatives began in 2000 when both the NSE and the BSE commenced trading in equity derivatives. In June 2000, index futures became the first type of derivative instruments to be launched in the Indian markets, followed by index options in June 2001, options in individual stocks in July 2001, and futures in single stock derivatives in November 2001. Since then, equity derivatives have come a long way. New products, an expanding list of eligible investors, rising volumes, and the best risk management framework for exchange-traded derivatives have been the hallmark of the journey of equity derivatives in India so far.

Derivatives markets broadly can be classified into two categories, those that are traded on the exchange and those traded one to one or ‘over the counter’. They are hence known as:

- Exchange Traded Derivatives
- OTC Derivatives (Over The Counter)
- OTC Equity Derivatives

Derivative trading in India takes place either on a separate and independent Derivative Exchange or on a separate segment of an existing Stock Exchange. Derivative Exchange/Segment function as a Self-Regulatory Organisation and SEBI acts as the oversight regulator. The clearing & settlement of all trades on the Derivative Exchange/Segment would have to be through a Clearing Corporation/Housing, which is independent in governance and membership from the Derivative Exchange/Segment. Derivatives trading takes place under the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.

The term Derivative has been defined in Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, as:-
---
A Derivative includes:

- a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security;
- a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying securities;

Derivative products have been introduced in a phased manner starting with Index Futures Contracts in June 2000. Index Options and Stock Options were introduced in June 2001 and July 2001 followed by Stock Futures in November 2001. Sectoral indices were permitted for derivatives trading in December 2002. During December 2007 SEBI permitted mini derivative (F&O) contract on Index (Sensex and Nifty). Further, in January 2008, longer tenure Index options contracts and Volatility Index and in April 2008, Bond Index was introduced. In addition to the above, during August 2008, SEBI permitted Exchange traded Currency Derivatives.

Measures specified by SEBI to protect the rights of investor in Derivatives Market are –

- Investor’s money has to be kept separate at all levels and is permitted to be used only against the liability of the Investor and is not available to the trading member or clearing member or even any other investor.
- The Trading Member is required to provide every investor with a risk disclosure document which will disclose the risks associated with the derivatives trading so that investors can take a conscious decision to trade in derivatives.
- Investor would get the contract note duly time stamped for receipt of the order and execution of the order. The order will be executed with the identity of the client and without client ID order will not be accepted by the system. The investor could also demand the trade confirmation slip with his ID in support of the contract note. This will protect him from the risk of price favour, if any, extended by the Member.
- In the derivative markets all money paid by the Investor towards margins on all open positions is kept in trust with the Clearing House/Clearing corporation and in the event of default of the Trading or Clearing Member the amounts paid by the client towards margins are segregated and not utilized towards the
---
default of the member. However, in the event of a default of a member, losses suffered by the Investor, if any, on settled / closed out position are compensated from the Investor Protection Fund, as per the rules, bye-laws and regulations of the derivative segment of the exchanges.

The Exchanges are required to set up arbitration and investor grievances redressal mechanism operative from all the four areas / regions of the country.

# 7. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS IN INDIA

The role of the financial system in India, until the early 1990s, was primarily restricted to the function of channeling resources from the surplus to deficit sectors. Whereas the financial system performed this role reasonably well, its operations came to be marked by some serious deficiencies over the years. The banking sector suffered from lack of competition, low capital base, low productivity and high intermediation cost.

After the nationalization of large banks in 1969 and 1980, public ownership dominated the banking sector. The role of technology was minimal and the quality of service was not given adequate importance. Banks also did not follow proper risk management system and the prudential standards were weak. All these resulted in poor asset quality and low profitability.

Among non-banking financial intermediaries, development finance institutions (DFIs) operated in an over-protected environment with most of the funding coming from assured sources at concessional terms. In the insurance sector, there was little competition. The mutual fund industry also suffered from lack of competition and was dominated for long by one institution, viz., the Unit Trust of India. Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) grew rapidly, but there was no regulation of their asset side. Financial markets were characterized by control over pricing of financial assets, barriers to entry, high transaction costs and restrictions on movement of funds/participants between the market segments. Apart from inhibiting the development of the markets, this also affected their efficiency.

Against this backdrop, wide-ranging financial sector reforms in India were introduced as an integral part of the economic reforms initiated in the early 1990s. Financial sector reforms in India were grounded in the belief that competitive efficiency in the real sectors of the economy will not be realized to its full potential unless the financial sector was reformed as well. Thus, the principal objective of financial sector reforms was to improve the allocative efficiency of resources and accelerate the growth process of the real sector by removing structural deficiencies affecting the performance of financial institutions and financial markets.

The main thrust of reforms in the financial sector was on the creation of efficient and stable financial institutions and markets. Reforms in respect of the banking as well as non-banking financial institutions
---
focused on creating a deregulated environment and enabling free play of market forces while at the same time strengthening the prudential norms and the supervisory system. In the banking sector, the focus was on imparting operational flexibility and functional autonomy with a view to enhancing efficiency, productivity and profitability, imparting strength to the system and ensuring accountability and financial soundness. The restrictions on activities undertaken by the existing institutions were gradually relaxed and barriers to entry in the banking sector were removed.

In the case of non-banking financial intermediaries, reforms focused on removing sector-specific deficiencies. Thus, while reforms in respect of DFIs focused on imparting market orientation to their operations by withdrawing assured sources of funds, in the case of NBFCs, the reform measures brought their asset side also under the regulation of the Reserve Bank. In the case of the insurance sector and mutual funds, reforms attempted to create a competitive environment by allowing private sector participation.

Reforms in financial markets focused on removal of structural bottlenecks, introduction of new players/instruments, free pricing of financial assets, relaxation of quantitative restrictions improvement in trading, clearing and settlement practices, more transparency, etc. Reforms encompassed regulatory and legal changes, building of institutional infrastructure, refinement of market microstructure and technological upgradation. In the various financial market segments, reforms aimed at creating liquidity and depth and an efficient price discovery process.

Reforms in the commercial banking sector had two distinct phases. The first phase of reforms, introduced subsequent to the release of the Report of the Committee on Financial System, 1992 (Chairman: Shri M. Narasimham), focused mainly on enabling and strengthening measures. The second phase of reforms, introduced subsequent to the recommendations of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms, 1998 (Chairman: Shri M. Narasimham) placed greater emphasis on structural measures and improvement in standards of disclosure and levels of transparency in order to align the Indian standards with international best practices.

During the last four decades, particularly after the first phase of nationalization of banks in 1969, there have been distinct improvements in the banking activities which strengthened the financial intermediation.
---
The total number of offices of public sector banks which was merely at 8262 in June 1969 increased to 62,607 as of June 2011. Similarly, there have been many fold increases in aggregate deposits and credit indicating existence of a vibrant bank-based financial system.

First, an important indicator of bank-based financial deepening, i.e. Private sector credit has expanded rapidly in the past five decades thereby supporting the growth momentum. Second, financial innovations have influenced velocity circulation of money by both reducing the transaction costs and enhancing the liquidity of financial assets. A relatively increasing value of velocity could be seen as a representative indicator of an efficient financial sector. In case of India, the velocity circulation of broad money has fallen since 1970s partly reflecting the fact that, in the midst of crisis, money injected to the system could not get distributed efficiently from the banking system to non-banks. Sharper fall in the velocity of narrow money reflected reluctance among banks as well as the public to part with liquidity.

Third, the market-based indicator of financial deepening, i.e., market capitalization-to-GDP ratio has increased very sharply in the past two decades implying for a vibrant capital market in India. Various reform measures undertaken since the early 1990s by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Government of India have brought about a significant structural transformation in the Indian capital market. Although the Indian equity market has become modern and transparent, its role in capital formation continues to be limited. Unlike in some advanced economies, the primary equity and debt markets in India have not yet fully developed. The size of the public issue segment has remained small as corporate have tended to prefer the international capital market and the private placement market. The private corporate debt market is active mainly in the form of private placements.

However, the domestic credit provided by the Indian banks still remains at an abysmally low as compared with major emerging market and developing economies (EDEs) and advanced economies. Furthermore, the level of credit disbursement is also far below the world average levels. Therefore, there is scope for the Indian banks to expand their business to important productive sectors of the economy.

India weathered the disruptions in the global financial system mainly due to a robust regulatory and supervisory framework, limited openness and global exposure of banking system with timely policy actions especially to manage liquidity. It was, however, acknowledged
---
that financial sector reforms has to keep progressing with continued improvements in regulation, supervision and stability areas in order to avoid build up of new vulnerabilities. The global financial crisis provided a renewed impetus to the second generation financial sector reforms in India whose major components could be identified as: (i) adherence to international standards, especially implementing G20 commitments; (ii) developmental measures; and (iii) stability measures.

Against the backdrop of a felt need that the legal and institutional structure of the Financial sector in India need to be reviewed and recast in tune with the contemporary requirements of the sector, The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, was set up by Ministry of Finance in March 2011 to review, simplify and rewrite the legal and institutional structures of the financial sector.

# 8. FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATIVE REFORMS

# COMMISSION (FSLRC)

The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) was constituted by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance; vide resolution dated 24th March 2011. The setting up of the FSLRC was the result of a felt need that the legal and institutional structures of the financial sector in India need to be reviewed and recast in tune with the contemporary requirements of the sector.

The institutional framework governing the financial sector has been built up over a century. There are over 60 Acts and multiple rules and regulations that govern the financial sector. Many of the financial sector laws date back several decades, when the financial landscape was very different from that seen today. For example, the RBI Act and the Insurance Act are of 1934 and 1938 vintage respectively. The Securities Contract Regulation Act was enacted in 1956, when derivatives and statutory regulators were unknown. The superstructure of the financial sector governance regime has been modified in a piecemeal fashion from time to time, without substantial changes to the underlying foundations.

These piecemeal changes have induced complex and cumbersome legislation, and raised difficulties in harmonising contradictory provisions. Such harmonisation is imperative for effectively regulating a dynamic market in the era of financial globalisation.

The piecemeal amendments have generated unintended outcomes including regulatory gaps, overlaps, inconsistencies and regulatory arbitrage. The fragmented regulatory architecture has led to a loss of scale and scope that could be available from a seamless financial market with all its attendant benefits of minimising the intermediation cost. For instance, complex financial intermediation by financial conglomerates of today falls under the purview of multiple regulators with gaps and overlaps. A number of expert committees have pointed out these discrepancies, and recommended the need for revisiting the financial sector legislations to rectify them. The need for complete review of the existing financial sector laws has been underlined to make the Indian financial sector more vibrant and dynamic in an increasingly interconnected world.

The remit of FSLRC, as contained in its Terms of Reference (ToR), comprises the following:

1. Review, simplify and rewrite the legislations affecting the financial
---
# 1. Introduction

Markets in India, focussing on broad principles.

# 2. Governance Principles

1. Evolve a common set of principles for governance of financial sector regulatory institutions.
2. Remove inconsistencies and uncertainties in legislations/Rules and Regulations.
3. Make legislations consistent with each other.
4. Make legislations dynamic to automatically bring them in tune with the changing financial landscape.
5. Streamline the regulatory architecture of financial markets.

Based on substantive research, extensive deliberations in the Commission and in its Working Groups, interaction with policy makers, regulators, experts and stakeholders; the Commission evolved a tentative framework on the legal–institutional structure required for the Indian financial sector in the medium to the long run. The broad contour of that framework was outlined in the Approach Paper released by the Commission in October 2012.

# 3. Approach Paper Highlights

- A uniform legal process for the financial sector regulators emphasising rule of law.
- A well-articulated principles-based approach to primary legislation emphasising a sound body of subordinate legislation based on these laws.
- Statutorily empowered, independent regulators with clear goals, powers and accountability.
- Removing twilight zones in the financial sector: every entity operating in the financial space needs to be on the radar of a financial regulator.
- Focusing on consumer protection - This is the ultimate objective of financial sector regulation as regulation per se is not an objective. Consumer protection has two components; prevention and cure. While financial regulators will address the former, the proposed financial redressal agency (FRA) spanning across the financial sector will deal with the latter addressing financial consumer grievances. A feed-back loop from the FRA to the regulators will help the latter in systemically addressing consumer grievances by appropriate regulations.
- A resolution mechanism to address failure of financial firms.
---
# 8.1. FSLRC Report – Volume I & II

Subsequent to the approach paper, the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission headed by Chairman Justice B.N.Srikrishna submitted a two volume report to the Ministry of Finance in March 2013, with its recommendations on the legal and institutional framework for the future of India’s financial system.

The main outcome of the Commission’s work is a draft ‘Indian Financial Code’ which is non-sectoral in nature, which is in Volume II of the report and replaces the bulk of the existing financial law. Volume 1 expresses the arguments that led up to the key decisions embedded in the draft Code.

The Commission identified nine components of focus for financial law:

1. consumer protection,
2. micro-prudential regulation,
3. resolution,
4. capital controls,
5. systemic risk,
6. development and redistribution,
7. monetary policy,
8. public debt management and
9. contracts trading & market abuse.

Under the proposed regulatory architecture, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Forward Markets Commission (FMC), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) would be merged into a new unified agency.
---
The Reserve Bank, however, will continue to exist with modified functions, said the two-volume report of the Commission. It said the existing Securities Appellate Tribunal be subsumed into Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT). It also suggested that Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) be given statutory framework. The panel also suggested setting up of a new Debt Management Office (DMO) and also subsuming the existing Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC) into the Resolution Corporation.

“The Commission believes that this proposed financial regulatory architecture is a modest step away from present practice, embeds important improvements, and will serve India well in coming years,” the Commission said.

According to the Commission, the actual functioning of the regulator lies in three areas -- regulation-making, executive functions and administrative law functions. With regard to capital control, the report said the Finance Ministry should make rules for inbound capital flows, while the onus of making rules for outbound capital flows should rest with the RBI.

“At present, in India, there is a confusing situation with regulators utilising many instruments such as regulations, guidelines, circulars, letters, notices and press releases. The draft Code requires all regulators to operate through a small number of well defined instruments only,” it said. It said, in an emergency the regulator can issue regulations. However, these regulations would lapse within six months.

The Commission has proposed a financial regulatory architecture featuring seven agencies –

1. The existing RBI will continue to exist, though with modified functions.
2. The existing SEBI, FMC, IRDA and PFRDA will be merged into a new unified agency.
3. The existing Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) will be subsumed
---
# 8.2. Draft Indian Financial Code, 2013

The draft Indian Financial Code submitted by the FSLRC contains 450 clauses under 15 Parts and 87 chapters with 6 schedules. It is a single unified and internally consistent draft law that replaces a large part of the existing Indian legal framework governing finance.

- The draft Code does not differentiate between different sectors in the financial system, the draft Code establishes a single framework for regulatory governance across all agencies.
- It creates a series of obligations for the Government and for regulators.
- The draft Code covers all functions of regulators, and defines the behaviour that is required from the regulator.
- It establishes certain elements of the functioning of board meetings, so as to ensure adequate oversight of the board over the organisation, and an emphasis on transparency.
- At present, in India, there is a confusing situation with regulators utilising many instruments such as regulations, guidelines, circulars, letters, notices and press releases. The draft Code requires all regulators to operate through a small number of well defined instruments only.

iv. The existing Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC) will be subsumed into the Resolution Corporation.

v. A new Financial Redressal Agency (FRA) will be created.

vi. A new Debt Management Office will be created.

vii. The existing FSDC will continue to exist, though with modified functions and a statutory framework.

The Commission has recommended the repeal or large scale amendment of all special legislations that (a) establish statutory financial institutions; or (b) lay down specific provisions to govern any aspect of the operation or functioning of public sector financial institutions.

The undertakings of all statutory institutions should be transferred to ordinary companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and their regulatory treatment should be identical as that applicable to all other financial companies.
---
The draft Code has specifics about each element of the executive powers. The first stage is the processing of permissions. A systematic process has been laid down through which permissions would be given.

The draft Code has a systematic approach where certain standard categories are defined, and principles guide the application of penalties. This would help induce greater consistency, and help produce greater deterrence.

A critical component of the framework for penalties is the mechanisms for compounding, which are laid on a sound foundation, and consistently applied across the entire financial system.

It establishes certain basic rights for all financial consumers.

The Commission envisages a unified Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT) that would hear all appeals in finance. A considerable focus has been placed, in the draft Code, on the functioning of the registry of FSAT, so as to achieve high efficiency.

The part on establishment of financial regulatory agencies provides for the creation of five new statutory bodies - UFA, Resolution Corporation, FRA, PDMA and FSAT. This part also provides for the allocation of regulatory responsibilities between the two financial sector regulators - UFA and RBI.

The draft Code however revisits the functions and powers of RBI, and sets out the manner in which it must be operated and governed. Similarly, in case of FSDC, the existing FSDC is to be recast as a statutory body.

The remaining provisions of the draft Code lay down the powers and functions of these statutory bodies and the principles and processes to govern the exercise of their powers.

# The Code envisages the establishment of the following agencies

1. Unified Financial Authority (UFA)
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3. Financial Redress Agency (FRA)
4. Resolution Corporation
5. Financial Stability & Development Council (FSDC)
6. Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA)
---
# 7) Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT)

The Code covers all functions of the regulator and lays down the principles and standards of behaviour expected from the regulator. It also provides for a system of monitoring the functions of the regulator with a process to ensure that the regulator is fully transparent and they act in compliance with the best practices of public administration. The Commission felt that the structure of the regulator should be standardised for all financial regulators except for certain exemptions where the general regulatory processes may not apply. These exceptions to the general process law should be kept to the minimum and generally avoided.

The consumer protection part of the Code has three components: an enumerated set of rights and protections for consumers, an enumerated set of powers in the hands of the regulator, and principles that guide what power should be used under what circumstances. The details of consumer protection would, of course, lie in the subordinated legislation to be drafted by financial regulators. The Commission felt that an overarching principle based body of law would allow regulatory flexibility, consistent treatment of consumers across all aspects of their engagement with the financial system, fairness and ultimately a more stable financial system. The basic objective of consumer protection is to guard consumer interests and to promote public awareness. While pursuing these objectives, the regulator will be empowered to make regulations to determine the manner and extent to which the protections under the law will apply to the users of different financial products and services.

The draft Code addresses fundamental concerns in the framework of capital controls, and provides for the following:

1. The rules on capital account transactions for all inbound flows including outflows that arise as a consequence of these inflows, will be made by the Central Government in consultation with the RBI. The regulations on capital account transactions for all outbound flows will be made by the RBI in consultation with the Central Government.
2. A single investment vehicle for investment in India i.e., qualified foreign investors (those foreign investors who meet the customer due diligence criteria prescribed by the Central Government);
3. A sound legal process while making rules for capital account transactions and while granting approvals;
---
# 4. A framework for imposition of controls in emergency situations

(such as war, natural calamity and balance of payment crises);

# 5. Review or restrictions on capital account transactions on national security considerations, by the Central Government or the RBI for inbound and outbound flows, respectively;

# 6. Review of decisions of the Central Government and the RBI; and

# 7. The principle that once controls are imposed at the entry level there must be equal treatment for Indian investors and foreign investors.

Ensuring compliance of provisions on capital controls in the draft Code, rules and regulations in relation to the capital controls is placed with the RBI in the draft Code. This would include oversight of reporting of foreign exchange transactions with the FDMC and ensuring compliance of the law, rules and regulations. Under conditions of full capital account convertibility, these functions will be placed with the Central Government.

The governance and operations of the public debt management agency would be handled through a two-tiered arrangement. At the top, there would be an advisory council, comprising of experts in finance, law, and public debt management. The advisory council must advise and issue opinions on any matter related to the objectives and functions of the public debt management agency that is referred to it by the agency or the Central Government. It must also advise and provide its opinion on the financing plans submitted by the public debt management agency to the Central Government, as well as the agency’s annual report, whenever such opinion is sought. The council must meet periodically to review and ratify the borrowing programme for the upcoming months.

The main benefit of an independent public debt management agency will come through the integration of public debt management functions and various databases and information, which are currently dispersed. By unifying the public debt management function, and efficiently linking it with the cash and the investment management functions, there will be improved information, analysis and thus decision making. With specialised human resources at its disposal, the public debt management agency can contribute to a more effective interface with the market resulting in cost-efficient management of Government borrowings.

A specialised, unified and independent agency will have significant comparative advantage over the existing structure of a fractured and uncoordinated Government borrowing programme spread across various agencies.

# 8.3. Adoption of Governance Enhancing and Non-Legislative Elements of the Draft Indian Financial Code

The Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, which was submitted to the Central Government in March 2013 has recommended transformation of the legal foundations for Indian finance, through the enactment of the IFC. The IFC establishes sound public administration and rule of law, and focuses financial agencies towards addressing market failures in the financial sector.

In its Eighth Meeting, the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) decided, inter alia that, “all the financial sector regulators (including FMC) will finalise an action plan for implementation of all the FSLRC principles relating to regulatory governance, transparency and
---
improved operational efficiency that do not require legislative action.

The FSDC accordingly approved twelve steps (and one item on the early implementation of these steps) that each regulator will take for the implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, that would enhance governance, and not require legislative action at present. This is given in the ‘Handbook on adoption of governance enhancing and non-legislative elements of the draft Indian Financial Code’.

# 1) Consumer Protection

The vulnerability of consumers reflects a major gap in Indian financial regulation. The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) has recommended the adoption of a consolidated consumer protection framework for the entire financial system that will empower and require regulators to pursue consumer protection for the financial activities under their jurisdiction. It has recommended legislative action on two fronts: prevention and cure.

Prevention requires regulation-making and enforcement across the entire financial system from the viewpoint of consumer interests. For example, regulation may prohibit use of certain unfair terms of contract, which unreasonably favor the financial service provider at the expense of consumers.

Cure requires providing consumers access to effective grievance redress mechanisms. The Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission has recommended a two-tiered system of grievance redress. First, there should be mandated grievance redress mechanism within each financial service provider. Second, it has recommended an Ombudsman-like mechanism to redress consumer grievances.

# 2) Consumer Protection for Retail Consumers

The Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission recommends giving certain rights and protections to retail consumers. Retail consumers are individuals and small organisations.

It is envisaged that the regulators will specify by regulation:

1. A cap on the value of the financial product or financial service, below which a consumer is considered a retail consumer;
---
# 2. A cap on the net asset value or turnover for organisations

below which such organisations may be considered retail consumers, as long as the value of the financial product or financial service they are availing or looking to avail is less than the cap specified above. Every regulator should specify these caps to create a category of retail consumers in the specific sector(s) it is regulating.

# 3) Framing Regulations

The FSLRC Analysis and Recommendations, lays down the key features of the desired regulation making system, which are:

1. The regulator will have to publish the following documents in the process of formulating new regulations:

1. Draft regulations;
2. Jurisdiction clause to identify the legal provision under which the proposed regulations are being made, and the manner in which the regulation is consistent with the principles in the concerned legislation(s). If the parent legislation does not specifically refer to the subject matter of regulations, the regulator will have to establish a logical connection between the subject matter and the empowering provision in the law;
3. A statement of the problem or market failure that the regulator seeks to address through the proposed regulations, which will be used to test the effectiveness with which the regulations address the stated problem. The statement must contain:
1. The principles governing the proposed regulations; and
2. The outcome the regulator seeks to achieve through the regulation;
4. An analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed regulation. This is required because every regulatory intervention imposes certain costs on regulated entities and the system as a whole.
2. The Commission recommends that regulations be drafted in a manner that minimises these compliance costs. In some cases where a pure numerical value based cost-benefit analysis is not possible, the regulator should provide the best possible analysis and reasoning for its choice of intervention.
3. After publishing the above documents, the regulator will specify a designated time for receiving comments from the public on the regulations and the accompanying documents.
---
# 4. The draft Code

The draft Code will ensure that the time period and the mode of participation specified by the regulator is appropriate to allow for widespread public participation.

# 4) Notices

One of the steps the IFC takes to ensure transparency and accountability is by requiring the standardisation of notices sent to regulated entities. The serving of a notice fulfills one of the requirements of the principles of natural justice. It seeks to give the recipient necessary information to respond to a regulator effectively, in order to defend his/her actions.

# 5) Transparency

Transparency refers to the practice of disclosing appropriate information to the public about the workings of an organisation, including the decision making processes as well as outcomes. The provisions of the IFC regarding transparency are:

1. Definition of the term ‘publish’.
2. The process of making regulations, and requiring publication of drafts of proposed regulations;
3. Publication of general and special guidance;
4. The requirement that a mandatory review of all regulations take place periodically, and the result of the review be published;
5. The publication of comments received during the rulemaking process; and
6. The minimum standard for publication of information.

# 6) Transparency in Board Meetings

Transparency in board meetings refers to the practice of allowing public scrutiny of the work of the board’s crucial functions. The boards of regulators have a critical role in ensuring good governance in the financial system, both by ensuring that best practices apply to regulators, and by creating a regulatory environment where good governance norms are upheld. Given this central role of boards, the FSLRC Analysis and Recommendations has made explicit reference to the need for transparency in board meetings.
---
# 7) Reporting

Reporting refers to the practice of measuring, recording and publishing data and information about an organisation’s activities, measured against the organisation’s objectives.

Effective reporting results in immediate and clear benefits to regulated entities and consumers. When regulators declare how they intend to perform their functions and fulfill their objectives in their reports, regulated entities better understand the nature and context of regulation imposed on them. This helps regulated entities to account for compliance costs. It also makes regulatory action more predictable and consistent, thereby increasing its legitimacy.

# 8) Approvals

Approvals refer to the permissions granted by regulators and government to carry out any regulated activity. Committing to a time-bound approval process increases predictability, and this helps firms to rationally plan for rollout of products and services. Commitment to clear service-level targets also lowers administrative and compliance costs, since time-consuming status checks and follow-up calls become unnecessary.

# 9) Investigation

Investigation refers to the process by which the regulator determines if there has been a violation of an provision of the law or subordinate regulation that the regulator enforces.

The rule of law in the financial sector would be further enhanced where regulators assign investigative duties to specialized staff, who are not involved making a final evaluation as to whether a violation has occurred, and what penalties to impose. This is already being done by most regulators. The IFC, however requires clearer structure to the investigative process. The investigating staff would present the results of their investigation to a separate cell or specialized group within the regulatory body, whose job it is to determine violations and penalties.

# 10) Adjudication

Both regulators and regulated entities benefit when adjudicatory decisions are viewed as legitimate, are easy to understand, and
---
serve as guidance to other parties in the future. For this reason, the adjudication process should mandate that adjudicatory decisions be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. An effective, transparent, fair adjudication process, accompanied by clear, well-reasoned decisions, is a critical mechanism for removing regulatory uncertainty.

# 11) Imposition of Penalty

While making regulations on the imposition of penalties in a proportional manner, regulators must consider the following factors (in addition to existing law):

1. The nature and seriousness of the violation, including whether it was deliberate, reckless or negligent;
2. The consequence and impact of the violation, including the extent of unfair enrichment of the violator, loss caused or likely to be caused;
3. The conduct of the violator after the occurrence of the violation; and
4. Prior violations or offences committed by the person.
---
# 9. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

The regulation and supervision of the financial system in India is carried out by different regulatory authorities. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates and supervises the major part of the financial system. The supervisory role of the RBI covers commercial banks, urban cooperative banks (UCBs), some financial institutions and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Some of the financial institutions, in turn, regulate or supervise other institutions in the financial sector, for instance, Regional Rural Banks and the Co-operative banks are supervised by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD); and housing finance companies by National Housing Bank (NHB). Department of Company Affairs (DCA), Government of India regulates deposit taking activities of corporate, other than NBFCS registered under companies Act, but not those which are under separate statutes. The Registrar of Cooperatives of different states in the case of single state cooperatives and the Central Government in the case of multi-state cooperatives are joint regulators, with the RBI for UCBs, and with NABARD for rural cooperatives. Whereas RBI and NABARD are concerned with the banking functions of the cooperatives, management control rests with the State/ Central Government. This “dual control” impacts the supervision and regulation of the cooperative banks. The capital market, mutual funds, and other capital market intermediaries are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) regulates the insurance sector; and the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) regulates the pension funds.

In India, the capital market is regulated by the Capital Markets Division of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The division is responsible for formulating the policies related to the orderly growth and development of the securities markets (i.e. share, debt and derivatives) as well as protecting the interest of the investors.

# 10.1. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

Negotiable instruments are of great importance in the business world and by extension in banking. They are instruments for making payments and discharging business obligations.

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 does not define a negotiable instrument but merely states, “a negotiable instrument means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or bearer.” (Section 13)

In simple words, negotiable means transferable and instrument means document.

Thus, the term, negotiable instrument means a written document which creates a right in favour of some person and which is freely transferable. Although the Act mentions only these three instruments.
---
(such as a promissory note, a bill of exchange and cheque), it does not exclude the possibility of adding any other instrument which satisfies the following two conditions of negotiability:

- The instrument should be freely transferable (by delivery or by endorsement and delivery) by the custom of the trade. Usually, when we transfer any property to somebody, we are required to make a transfer deed, get it registered, pay stamp duty, etc. But, such formalities are not required while transferring a negotiable instrument. The ownership is changed by mere delivery (when payable to the bearer) or by valid endorsement and delivery (when payable to order). Further, while transferring it is also not required to give a notice to the previous holder.
- The person who obtains it in good faith and for value should get it free from all defects, and be entitled to recover the money of the instrument in his own name. This means that a person who receives a negotiable instrument has a clear and undisputable title to the instrument. However, the title of the receiver will be absolute, only if he has got the instrument in good faith and for a consideration.

# About the Act

It is an Act to define and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques.

The Negotiable Instruments Act was enacted, in India, in 1881 and came into force on the 1st day of March, 1882. Prior to its enactment, the provision of the English Negotiable Instrument Act were applicable in India, and the present Act is also based on the English Act with certain modifications. It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The main object of the Negotiable Instruments Act is to legalise the system by which instruments contemplated by it could pass from hand to hand by negotiation like any other goods. The purpose of the Act was to present an orderly and authoritative statement of leading rules of law relating to the negotiable instruments. To achieve the objective of the Act, the Legislature thought it proper to make provision in the Act for conferring certain privileges to the mercantile instruments contemplated under it and provide special procedure in case the obligation under the instrument was not discharged.

# 10.4. Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956

Stock exchanges in India are regulated and controlled by the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. The objective of the Act is to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein, by providing for certain other matters connected therewith. The Act extends to the whole of India and came into force on 28th February, 1957.

The Act provides for direct and indirect control of almost all aspects of securities trading including the running of stock exchanges which aims to prevent undesirable transactions in securities.

The Act gives the Central Government regulatory jurisdiction over stock exchanges through a process of recognition and continued supervision, contracts in securities and listing of securities on stock exchanges. As a condition of recognition, the stock exchange should comply with the requirements prescribed by the Central Government. The stock exchange should frame their own listing regulations in consonance with the minimum listing criteria set out in the Securities Contracts Regulation Rules, 1957.

“Stock exchange” means—

- (a) any body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, constituted before corporatisation and demutualisation under sections 4A and 4B, or

However, in the interest of the trade or the public the said period can be extended from time to time, provided that no such period of suspension can be extended, unless the governing body of the recognised stock exchange has been given an opportunity of being heard in the matter.

# Listing

Where a recognised stock exchange refuses to list the securities of any public company or collective investment scheme, the company or scheme may appeal to the Central Government against such refusal, omission or failure, as the case may be. Where a recognised stock exchange refuses to list the securities of any public company or collective investment scheme, the company or scheme may appeal to the SAT against such refusal, omission or failure, as the case may be.

# 10.5. Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992

Securities regulation began in India with the Capital Issues (Control) Act of 1947, which had its origin during the war in 1943, with the objective to support the war effort. The Act was retained with some modifications as a means of control over the raising of capital by companies and to serve goals and priorities of the government; however, as part of the liberalization process, the Act was repealed in 1992 paving the way for market determined allocation of resources.

In 1988 the Securities Exchange Board of India was established by the Government of India through an executive resolution and was subsequently upgraded as a fully autonomous body (a statutory board) in the year 1992 with the passing of the securities Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 on 30th January, 1992. In the place of Government control, a statutory and autonomous regulatory board with defined responsibilities, to cover both development and regulation in the market, and independent powers were set up.

The basic objectives of Securities Exchange Board of India are:

1. To protect the interests of investors in securities;
2. To promote the development of the securities market;

# 10.6. Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993

The Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (RDBFI Act) was passed by the Parliament of India to provide for the speedy adjudication of matters relating to recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions. This Act provided a procedure that was distinct from the existing Code of Civil Procedure in order to ensure such a speedy adjudication. This Act also provided for setting up of a separate set of tribunals to hear such matters and these tribunals are termed as Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs). The Government has set up such DRTs in many states in the country. Presently there are thirty three Debt Recovery Tribunals and five Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals across the country.

The provisions of RDDBI Act, 1993 will not apply where the amount of debt due to any bank or financial institution or to a consortium of banks or financial institutions is less than ten lakh rupees or such other amount, being not less than one lakh rupees.

The RDDBI Act, 1993 provides Banks and Financial Institutions to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal by filing an application for recovering its due. Only when the amount of due qualifies under the Act,
---
The Banks and Financial Institutions could approach the Debt Recovery Tribunals under RDDBI Act, 1993. When the Bank approaches the Tribunal for recovery, then, the Tribunal will look into the claim made by the Bank in accordance with the procedure prescribed under RDDBI Act, 1993 and finally pass an award. The award can be executed by the Bank.

The procedures adopted in DRTs are very simple and uncomplicated. Unlike higher costs in civil courts, the DRT proceedings are cheaper. Within 30 days of filing DRT application, summons are sent to the defendants, who have to immediately submit their reply statements. Evidences are admitted in the form of sworn affidavit. Defendants are given the opportunity to cross examine bank’s witness. As per the Act, the Tribunal has to decide the case within six months from the filing of case.

Any person aggrieved by any measure taken by secured creditor or his authorized officer may file an appeal to Debts Recovery Tribunal, within 45 days from date on which such measure was taken i.e. action of taking possession of asset, takeover of management of business of borrower, appointing person to manage secured asset etc. is taken by the creditor.

When a borrower files an appeal, the appeal cannot be entertained unless; the borrower deposits 75% of the amount claimed in the notice by secured creditor. The DRT can waive or reduce the amount required to be deposited. The amount is not required to be deposited at the time of filing appeal, but appeal will not be heard till the amount is deposited. The borrower while filing the appeal should also file an application requesting the Debt Recovery Tribunal to admit the appeal without deposit of any amount. If the DRT orders partial deposit of the amount and the same is not deposited, appeal can be dismissed. The 75% deposit is only required if the appeal is filed by the borrower. If some other aggrieved person (e.g. guarantor, shareholder) files it the deposit is not required.

If a person is aggrieved by the order of the DRT, it can file an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal within 30 days from date of receipt of the DRT order.

If the DRT or Appellate Tribunal holds that possession of assets by the secured creditor was wrongful and directs the secured creditor to return asset to concerned borrower, the borrower shall be entitled to
---
compensation and costs as may be determined by DRT or Appellate tribunal.

The Tribunal can also direct return of asset, if the secured creditor had already sold or transferred the asset to a third party.

The tribunal can also make an interim order (injunction or stay or attachment) against the defendant to debar him from transferring, alienating or disposing of any property and assets belonging to him. In the case of disobedience of an order made by the Tribunal, or breach of any of the terms on which the order was made the Tribunal may order the properties of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach, to be attached and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison.

The Tribunal has the power to appoint a receiver of any property, to remove any person from the possession or custody of the property and commit the same to the possession, custody or management of the receiver for the realization, management, protection, preservation and improvement of the property, the collection of the rents and profits thereof, the application and disposal of such rents and profits and the execution of documents as the owner himself has, or can appoint a Commissioner for preparation of an inventory of the properties of the defendant or for the sale thereof.

# 10.7. Depositories Act, 1996

The Depositories Act, 1996 provides a legal framework for establishment of depositories to facilitate holding of securities including shares in the demat form (electronic form) and to effect transfer of securities through book entry. The Act establishes the depository system in India by providing for setting up of one or more depositories to enable the investors to hold securities in non-physical form (known as dematerialized form) and to affect transfer of securities by way of book entries in accounts maintained by the depository.

“Depository” means a company formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), and which has been granted a certificate of registration under sub-section (1A) of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992). (Sec.2(1)(e) of Depositories Act, 1996)
---
The depository system envisages a deposit of securities by various investors with the depository. Once the securities are lodged with the depository, their transfer would be through book entry transfers in accounts maintained by the depository. Thus the main function of a depository is to dematerialize the securities and enable their transaction in book entry form.

Every depository is required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and will have to obtain a Certificate for commencement of business on fulfillment of the prescribed conditions. Rights and obligations of Depositories, Participants, Issuers and Beneficial Owners are given below:

The issuer, on receipt of certificate of security shall cancel the certificate of security and substitute in its records the name of the depository as a registered owner in respect of that security and inform the depository accordingly. The depository, thereafter will enter the name of that person in its records, as the beneficial owner (Sec. 6).

# 4. Registration of Transfer of Securities with Depository:

Every depository shall, on receipt of intimation from a participant, register the transfer of security in the name of the transferee. Further, if a beneficial owner or a transferee of any security seeks to have custody of such security, the depository shall inform the issuer accordingly (Sec. 7).

# 5. Options to Receive Security Certificate or Hold Securities with Depository:

The depository as a registered owner shall not have any voting rights or any other rights in respect of securities held by it. The beneficial owner shall be entitled to all the rights and benefits and be subjected to all the liabilities in respect of his securities held by a depository (Sec. 10).

# 8. Register of Beneficial Owner:

Every depository shall maintain a register and an index of beneficial owners in the manner provided in the Companies Act.

# 9. Pledge or Hypothecation of Securities Held in a Depository:

A beneficial owner may with the previous approval of the depository, create a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by him through a depository.

# 10. Furnishing of Information and Records by Depository and Issuer:

Every depository is required to furnish to the issuer information about the transfer of securities in the name of beneficial owners at such intervals and in such manner as may be specified by the bye-laws. Every issuer also has to make available to the depository copies of the relevant records in respect of securities held by such depository (Sec. 13).

# 11. Option to opt out in Respect of any Security:

If a beneficial owner seeks to opt out of a depository in respect of any security, he shall inform the depository accordingly who will make appropriate entries in its records and shall inform the issuer (Sec. 14).

# 12. Depositories to Indemnify Loss in Certain Cases:

91
---
# Penalties

# 10.8. Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999

Exchange Control in India dates back to 1939 when for the first time it was introduced as a war measure under the Defence of India Rules. Soon after independence, a complex web of controls were imposed for all external transactions through a legislation i.e., Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1947. These were put into a more rigorous framework of controls through FERA, 1973. Severe restrictions on current account transactions had continued till mid-1990s when relaxations were made in the operations of the FERA, 1973. The control framework was essentially transaction based in terms of which all transactions in foreign exchange including those between residents and non-residents were prohibited, unless specifically permitted.

In the 1990s, consistent with the general philosophy of economic reforms a sea change relating to the broad approach to reform in the external sector took place. The Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments (Chairman: Dr. C. Rangarajan, 1993) set the broad agenda in this regard. The Committee recommended, inter alia, the introduction of a market-determined exchange rate regime within limits; liberalisation of current account transactions leading to current account convertibility; compositional shift in capital flows away from debt to non debt creating flows; strict regulation of external commercial borrowings, especially short-term debt; discouraging volatile elements of flows from non-resident Indians; full freedom for outflows associated with inflows (i.e., principal, interest, dividend, profit and sale proceeds) and gradual liberalisation of other outflows; and dissociation of Government in the intermediation of flow of external assistance, as in the 1980s, receipts on capital account and external financing were confined to external assistance through multilateral and bilateral sources.

The sequence of events in the subsequent years generally followed these recommendations. In 1993, exchange rate of rupee was made market determined; close on the heels of this important step, India accepted Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund in August 1994 and adopted the current account convertibility.

In 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility (CAC), constituted by the Reserve Bank, had indicated the preconditions for Capital Account Convertibility. The three crucial preconditions were fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target and, strengthening of the financial system. The Tarapore Committee had also recommended

# 10.9. SARFAESI Act, 2002

The Securitisation Act empowers the banks and financial institutions to move on its own against a borrower whose assets are secured, and who has made some kind of default in repayment of the same.

The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. Thus after complying with the statutory provisions in the said act the banks can:

- Take possession of the secured assets of the borrower. This includes the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the same for realization of the secured debt.
- Take over the management of the secured asset including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the same for realization of the secured debt.
- Appoint any person to manage the secured asset.

The Act deals with three aspects.

---
# Financial Institutions

- Transfer of non-performing assets to Asset Reconstruction Company, which will then dispose of those assets and realize the proceeds.
- To provide a legal framework for securitisation of assets.

# Incorporation and registration of Special Purpose Companies

SCO and RCO ought to be a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 having securitisation and asset reconstruction respectively as main object. The Securitisation Act requires compulsory registration of SCO and RCO under the Securitisation Act before commencing its business. Further a minimum financial stability requirement is also provided by requiring SCO and RCO to possess owned fund of Rs.2 crore or up to 15% of the total financial assets acquired or to be acquired. The RBI has the power to specify the rate of owned fund from time to time. Different rates can be prescribed for different classes of SCO and RCO.

# Enforcement of Security Interest

Under the Act security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced, without the intervention of court or tribunal, by such creditor in accordance with the provision of this Act.

Where any borrower, who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security agreement, makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any installment thereof, and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non-performing asset, then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor within sixty days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under sub-section (4) of Sec.13. In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified above, the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt, namely:

1. take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for releasing the secured asset.
---
(b) take over the management of the assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for releasing the secured asset.

(c) appoint any person to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor.

(d) require at any time by notice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money any money is due or may become due to the borrower, to pay the secured creditor so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt.

# 12. INSURANCE

Insurance is a contract whereby, in return for the payment of premium by the insured, the insurers pay the financial losses suffered by the insured as a result of the occurrence of unforeseen events. With the help of Insurance, a large number of people exposed to similar risks makes contributions to a common fund out of which the losses suffered by the unfortunate few, due to accidental events, are made good.

An insurer is a company selling the insurance; an insured or policyholder is the person or entity buying the insurance. The insurance rate is a factor used to determine the amount to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage, called the premium.

Insurance business is divided into following types of business namely:

1. Life Insurance, and
2. General Insurance
1. Marine insurance
2. Fire insurance
3. Motor vehicle insurance
4. Miscellaneous insurance
3. Reinsurance

# Life Insurance

Life insurance is a contract that pledges payment of an amount to the person assured (or his nominee) on the happening of the event insured against. The contract is valid for payment of the insured amount during:

- The date of maturity, or
- Specified dates at periodic intervals, or
- Unfortunate death, if it occurs earlier.

Among other things, the contract also provides for the payment of premium periodically to the Corporation by the policyholder. Life insurance is universally acknowledged to be an institution, which eliminates ‘risk’, substituting certainty for uncertainty and comes to the timely aid of the family in the unfortunate event of death of the breadwinner.
---
# General Insurance

Insurance other than ‘Life Insurance’ falls under the category of General Insurance. General Insurance comprises of insurance of property against fire, burglary etc, personal insurance such as Accident and Health Insurance, and liability insurance which covers legal liabilities.

Non-life insurance companies have products that cover property against Fire and allied perils, flood storm and inundation, earthquake and so on. There are products that cover property against burglary, theft etc. The non-life companies also offer policies covering machinery against breakdown. There are policies that cover the hull of ships and so on. A Marine Cargo policy covers goods in transit including by sea, air and road. Further, insurance of motor vehicles against damages and theft forms a major chunk of non-life insurance business.

# Micro Insurance

The term Micro-insurance is used to refer to insurance to the low-income people, and is different from insurance in general as it is a low value product (involving modest premium and benefit package) which requires different design and distribution strategies such as premium based on community risk rating (as opposed to individual risk rating), active involvement of an intermediate agency representing the target community and so forth.

India is the first country to introduce regulation for micro insurance, i.e. the IRDA (Micro-Insurance) Regulations, 2005 and it is one of the few developing countries in the world that has a special micro-insurance regulation to regulate the suppliers of micro-insurance products through its special agency for insurance regulation – the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority.

A Micro-Insurance Policy means an Insurance Policy sold under a Plan which has been specifically approved by the IRDA as a Micro-Insurance product.

# 13. FINANCIAL PLANNING

A financial plan is a series of steps which are carried out, or goals that are accomplished, which relate to an individual’s financial affairs. It is a series of steps or specific goals undertaken for spending and saving future income. This plan allocates future income to various types of expenses and also reserves some income for short-term and long-term savings.

The importance of financial planning especially in the present scenario cannot be overstated. Among others, two factors are responsible for the same i.e. inflation and changing lifestyles. Inflation is a situation where too much money chases a limited number of goods. This leads to a fall in the value of money. It is also expressed as a rise in the general price level. Financial planning can ensure that one is equipped to deal with the impact of inflation, especially in phases like retirement when expenses continue but income streams dry up. The second factor is changing lifestyles. With higher disposable incomes, it is common for individuals to upgrade their standard of living. Apart from these, there are contingencies like medical emergencies or unplanned expenditure that an individual might have to cope with. Sound financial planning can enable him to easily mitigate such situations, without straining his finances.

It is possible to manage income effectively through financial planning. It helps in segregating it into tax payments, other monthly expenditures and savings. Financial planning is also necessary from the point of family security. The various policies available in the market serve the purpose of financially securing the family. The savings created through appropriate planning come to the rescue in difficult times. Death of the bread winner in a family, affects the standard of living to a great extent. A proper financial plan such as a Will, acts as a guard in such situations and enables the family to survive hard times.

# Investment

A person gets income as salary or wages, business profits, professional fees etc. Savings is nothing but the surplus available over the expenses. This surplus amount needs to be invested to ensure future returns. Investment can be in various schemes available in the financial market like deposits, mutual funds, insurance policies, pension schemes etc. One has to analyze the cost of investment over the other and then decide which will be appropriate and a better investment opportunity.
---
# Investment

Investment is an asset or item that is purchased with the hope that it will generate income or appreciate in the future. In finance, investment means the purchase of a financial product or other item of value with an expectation of favorable future returns.

# Small savings schemes in India

Small Saving schemes have been always an important source of household savings in India and they are essentially a basket of diversified and heterogeneous products. Although these instruments are technically not Government Securities and do not have any explicit Government guarantee, their legacy has given them characteristic of being equivalent to that of a Sovereign liability. These schemes have been extremely popular amongst a large number of small investors in India who seek to invest in a secure instrument. At the same time, these instruments have been treated as a means of providing social benefit to the small savers.

The Government formulates a basket of small savings schemes to meet the varying needs of different groups of small investors. In respect of each scheme, statutory rules are framed by the Central Government indicating the various details including the rate of interest and the maturity period.

Being liabilities of the Central Government, the schemes are perceived to be devoid of any risk and a surrogate for social security among the public.

Broadly, three types of small saving schemes are currently in operation in India. These are postal deposits, saving certificates and social security schemes like PPF and retirement schemes.

# 14. STATE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS

A Central Industrial Finance corporation was set up under the Industrial Finance Corporations Act, 1948 in order to provide medium and long term credit to industrial undertakings which fall outside normal activities of commercial banks. The State governments expressed their desire that similar corporations be set up in states to supplement the work of the Industrial Financial Corporation. State governments also expressed that the State corporations be established under a special statute in order to make it possible to incorporate in the constitutions necessary provisions in regard to majority control by the government, guaranteed by the State government in regard to the payment principal. In order to implement the views expressed by the State governments, the State Financial Corporation Act of 1951 was passed.

The State Financial Corporations (SFCs) provide the following types of assistance to industrial units in their respective states:

- The SFCs while giving loans to industrial units see to it that loans are secured by a pledge, mortgage, hypothecation of movable and immovable property or other tangible assets or guarantee by the state government or scheduled commercial bank; they also accept personal pledge by the entrepreneur. SFCs do not give loans on the basis of second mortgage.
- Grant loans or advances to industrial concerns repayable within a period not exceeding 20 years.
- Providing guarantee for loans raised by industrial units from commercial banks and state cooperative banks.
